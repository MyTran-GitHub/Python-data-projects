In this project, you’ll work with a time series that tracks the tide levels of the Thames River. You’ll first load the data and inspect it data visually, and then perform calculations on the dataset to generate some summary statistics. You’ll end by reducing the time series to its component attributes and analyzing them. \n","\n","The original dataset is available from the British Oceanographic Data Center [here](https://www.bodc.ac.uk/data/published_data_library/catalogue/10.5285/b66afb2c-cd53-7de9-e053-6c86abc0d251) and you can read all about this fascinating archival story in [this article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01223-7) from the Nature journal.\n","\n","Here's a map of the locations of the tidal meters along the River Thames in London.\n","\n","![](locations.png)\n","\n","\n","The TXT file contains data for three variables, described in the table below. \n","\n","| Variable Name | Description | Format |\n","| ------------- | ----------- | ------ |\n","| Date and time | Date and time of measurement to GMT.
